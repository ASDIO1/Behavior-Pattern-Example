## Thematic

The thematic that I proposed for this project is about a machine that creates glass.

I chose this thematic to implement the **State** behavior pattern.

The states of glass are Sand, Mixed state with other compunds, Melting state, Molding state and the Finished glass state.

The transition between states is explained by the program when excecuting it.

## Solution

As I mentioned before, I chose to implement this thematic with the **State** behavior pattern.


## Program guide

Run this program with a C# compiler.

The way I run this program is by excecuting the solution (.sln) file with visual studio 2019.

The program (program.cs) uses the **State** pattern and for each state the program prints a brief description of each state of glass.

The (.sln) file can be found at: Behavior-Pattern-Example\GlassCreationStates
